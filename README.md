# libcrowds-discourse-theme

A supplementary [Discourse](https://github.com/discourse/discourse) theme for
the [LibCrowds](http://www.libcrowds.com) crowdsourcing platform. The theme basically
just imports the main stylesheet from [libcrowds-pybossa-theme](https://github.com/LibCrowds/libcrowds-pybossa-theme)
and adds a handful of tweaks.


## Installation

In Discourse, go to Admin > Customize > CSS/HTML and click the **Import** button.
Import the file [libcrowds.json](libcrowds.json), then make sure **Enabled** is
checked and click **Save**.
